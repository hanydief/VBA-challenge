 # Assignment Explanation
* Worksheet has 3 tabs all are working with outstanding results
* Each Sheet contains 4 buttons:
    1. Can run all sheets
    2. Clear & reset all Sheets
    3. Run Current active sheet individually Only
    4. Clear & reset Current Active sheet only
* When you run the sheet or sheets you will get a popup message notifying you process is running, each sheet has a single popup message & one single popup message at the end notifying its done to avoide any confussion since running file takes few seconds
* Since Yearly Change column will have Negative (-ve) values & depends on excel column format some times (-ve)s might show in red & since Assignment requires negative to she RED cells number will not be visable therefore this column has color formating at the end to switch RED to BLACK.
* Outputs are:
    1. The ticker symbol
    2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    4. The total stock volume of the stock. matching requested image.
    5. BONUS: Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the requested image.
    6. BONUS: Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

# VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. Depending on your comfort level with VBA, you may choose to challenge yourself with a few of the challenge tasks.

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `VBA-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

### Stock Market Analyst

## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

**Note:** Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The result should match the following image:

![moderate_solution](Images/moderate_solution.png)

## Bonus

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

![hard_solution](Images/hard_solution.png)

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.

## Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3 to 5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with one click of a button.

* Some assignments, like this one, contain a bonus. It is possible to achieve proficiency for this assignment without completing the bonus. The bonus is an opportunity to further develop your skills and be rewarded extra points for doing so.

## Submission

To submit, please upload the following to GitHub:

  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the multi-year stock data.

  * VBA scripts as separate files.

Be sure to commit regularly to your repository and that it contains a README.md file.

After saving your work, create a shareable link and submit the link to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>.
